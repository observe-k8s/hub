### Agenda

[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/observe-k8s/projects/1/views/1)

* Demo app
  * Loki for logging
  * Prometheus for metrics
  * Want to deploy it somewhere for KubeCon
    * Michael can setup the demo on EKS in AWS and expose on observek8s.io
      * He would be the only one that can access
      * Example for automated [AWS ALB creation](https://github.com/mhausenblas/noteless/blob/master/listings/create-alb.sh)
    * AI: Henrik will create a bash script to setup the environment to simplify the deploy for Michael
    * AI: Ken to work with Matt on defining a stable URL for the deployment to utilize
      * `demo.observe-k8s.io`
    * Should consider automation for environment to keep it operational
* Look to extract the infrastructure setup aspects out of the demo into a separate project
