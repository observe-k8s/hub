CNCF TAG Observability Working Group (WG)

## 2023-12-06

Attendees

* Ken Finnigan
* Henrik Rexed

### Agenda

[Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/observe-k8s/projects/1/views/1)

* Henrik suggested turning the k8s observability deployment into a workshop
  * The workshop can be run at KCDs and other conferences
  * Suggested as a next step, as opposed to the Ops needed to run a solution for anyone to use directly
    * Also a way to drive interest in the project
  * Also consider whether it's possible, or makes sense, to have the workshop on something like https://killercoda.com/
  * The website can host the workshop steps

### Action Items

* Plan out the work to create a workshop
